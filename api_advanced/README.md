# Reddit API Advanced Project

This project focuses on practicing and mastering interactions with the Reddit API to prepare for technical interviews and real-world applications. It involves implementing functions to:

- Retrieve the number of subscribers for a given subreddit, handling invalid subreddits gracefully.
- Print the titles of the top 10 hot posts in a subreddit, with validation.
- Recursively fetch all hot post titles from a subreddit and perform keyword frequency analysis, sorting results by count and alphabetically.

Key learning objectives include understanding API documentation, handling pagination, parsing JSON data, making recursive API calls, and sorting dictionaries by values. The code must adhere to Python best practices, including PEP 8, proper headers, and using the Requests library with appropriate headers to respect Reddit's rate limits and authentication requirements.
